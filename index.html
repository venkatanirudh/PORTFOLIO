<div id="introduction" >
    
    <p>
        I’m a software engineer passionate about <span class="bold">building reliable, scalable, and impactful systems</span>—whether that means crafting intuitive web applications, automating infrastructure, or streamlining data workflows. I enjoy working across the stack, blending strong backend engineering with cloud-native DevOps practices to deliver products that are both <span class="bold">robust and user-focused</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        I graduated with a Master’s in Computer Science from Emory University in May 2025, where I worked as a Software Developer at the <span class="bold">LUMeN Lab</span>. There, I built modular web interfaces, real-time data pipelines, and automated research workflows that significantly improved <span class="bold">data quality and accessibility</span> for behavioral studies.
    </p>
    <p>
        Previously, I worked at <span class="bold">Accenture with Kaiser Permanente</span>, where I developed enterprise microservices, modernized CI/CD pipelines, and deployed large-scale workloads on Azure Kubernetes Service. My experience spans everything from designing distributed data processing pipelines with Kafka to enhancing observability with Prometheus and Grafana. Earlier in my career, I also interned at <span class="bold">Virtusa</span>, where I built secure, microservices-based e-commerce platforms with Spring Boot and Angular.
    </p>
    <p>
        Outside of work, I enjoy playing badminton, solving chess puzzles, and sharpening my problem-solving skills on LeetCode. I’m always curious about tackling new challenges that blend software engineering with <span class="bold">automation and data</span>.
